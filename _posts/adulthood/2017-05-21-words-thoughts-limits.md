# Words

>Common belief tells us that language carries the meaning in order to communicate. Like a boat would carry merchandise. Wrong. Love doesn’t mean anything. Sky doesn’t mean anything. Meaning doesn’t mean anything. Language does not carry the meaning, rather, it triggers a response in the mind of the recipient. And it is this response that we call meaning. Language is the electricity that turns up the light, not the light itself. And this perspective changes everything.

He goes on to say that language is a scalpel:
> Of course, language and meaning are intimately intertwined, always influencing one another. Languages are influenced by the culture of the people that speak it. It is no coincidence that Eskimos have hundreds of words for the snow, they simply deal more with snow on a daily basis. We use the vocabulary that we need to label what we deal with in our environment. And the more we deal with snow, the more variations in language we need, the more words we come up with.

> Vice versa, language influences the way we think. The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis even states that depending on the language we speak, we have a different way of viewing the world. For instance, the Russians have two words for blue — one for light blue and another for dark blue. Therefore, they tend to process them differently, like we think of green and red as two different colours. We think in terms of boxes all of the time because of language, and this comes out on our way to think about the world.
