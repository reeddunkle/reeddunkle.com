# Advanced Options

## Combat Options

#### Automatically reload weapons when you're not firing - **No**

#### Fast weapon switch - **Yes**

#### Play a hit sound every time you injure an enemy	 - **Yes**

#### Display damage done as text over your target - **Yes**

#### Accumulate combat text damage events into a single number - **Yes**

## Class-specific Options

#### Spy: Enable concise disguise menu - **Yes**

This can take some getting used to if you're already familiar with the default disguise menu. Despite the extra keystroke required, being able to access the disguises on the right of the menu with my left hand makes it worth it.

#### Medic: Medi Gun continues healing without holding down fire button - No

This is off by default. I'm including it because some guides instruct you to turn this on. I strongly recommend leaving it off. With it on, while healing a teammate, it makes it much more cumbersome to quickly switch your healing target. Since I like to toggle my Ubers, this is a costly interference.

#### Medic: Display a marker over the player you are healing - **Yes**

#### Medic: Injured teammates automatically call out - **Yes**

#### Medic: Auto-call health percentage - **99.00**

These last two options gives you vital information. Any time anyone takes damage, you'll be notified. True, it can create some noise. Sometimes I miss the player whose the most damaged. But there are other cues that indicate severity.

## HUD Options

#### Enable minimal HUD - **Yes**

This gives you more space on your screen. It will take a day of playing to get used to it. Some serious players disable their player model all together. I've never messed with that.

#### Viewmodel field of view - **70.00**

This gives you more peripheral vision.

#### TargetID - Disable floating health bar

As a medic especially, this makes seeing your targets health bar easier.

## Miscellaneous Options

#### Suicide after choosing a player class - **No**

I prefer to spawn as a new class on my next life.

#### Automatically respawn after loadout changes in respawn zones - Yes

This is on by default, I just want to make a note that this is what enables you to [quickly refill your ammo as Engineer](../2017-05-13-options/2017-05-13-options.md).

#### Use minimized viewmodels - **Yes**

This gives you more space on your screen. It will take a day of playing to get used to it.

#### Disable sprays - **Yes**

Sprays are an old Half-Life thing that were worked into Valves following two games, Team Fortress Classic and Counter Strike. I never got into it, so I just do away with them all.
