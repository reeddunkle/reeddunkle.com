# Spy

Because the Spy's main attack is a backstab, and the secondary is his sapper, his encounters take place up close and personal. It gives me more of an adrenaline rush than playing a class that hangs back in safety, like the sniper for example.

In casual match-making with up to 12 players on each team, a map's territory becomes much more important. Rather than make a guide for each map, I'm going to use Badwater as an example to illustrate concepts that can be applied to all of the maps.

## Map Zones

These aren't cleanly delineated, but combat on a map creates some different zone fronts. I'm taking this concept from Viglante Gamer's [Zones in Day Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnSqK2Yfix0)

Zone 1 is the main conflict. It's where the two team's front lines are currently engaging. This front is more obvious in game modes where Blue attacks and Red defends. Blue makes concrete progress, and so Zone 1 occurs somewhere between their current spawn, and Red's. At the start, Red will be pushing the front toward Blue's spawn, and as Blue makes progress the front pushes back toward Red's spawn until Blue is able to capture the point.

When I first started playing TF2, this was the only Zone I was really aware of. It's the most obvious, and where 90% of the players will run to after spawning. In order to understand and spot the other zones, you have to learn the map and discover its dimensions.

Flanking deserves a special shoutout. Initially, it offers the flanker a better kill and survival advantage. Players' attention is drawn toward the other Zones, so if you can flank a player who's focusing elsewhere you can kill them. This draws attention to the flanker, though. The players in other zones should come take care of the flanker. This weakens the team on those other fronts, through, which often has the result of shifting Zone 1's front.

For example...

### Point 1

Zone 1 (Green): Zone 1 takes place around Red's fort, up the cart's tracks, and the elevated structure beside Red's fort.
Zone 2 (Teal): These are the flanks. Defensively, they prevent the enemy from flanking. Offensively, you can use them to flank, which can shift the main focus of combat further back (at the location of the flank's engagement), which lets Blue push up. Note than in TF2 there are vertical flanks. Blue soldiers might be coming over top the fort for example.
Zone 3 (Red): These are the Snipers, and possibly Engineer teleporter, etc. Players in Zone 3 are hoping to effectively support their team from a safe distance.
Zone 4 (not pictured): The rest of the map where no fighting is happening.

For the most part, players are subconsciously aware of these Zones. People don't like to let snipers sit in safety, and so players will pursue other players across zones.

What's interesting, though, is that the Zones are actually defined by the points of contact, not by the map structures. True, the map creates opportunities that can be taken advantage of to control where the zones are defined. But, if all of the players on Blue are on the flank behind Red's fort, that flank has become Zone 1.

#### Example

Say the game starts as usual, with a big blood bath outside Blue's spawn, killing the same amount on both teams. Because this is right outside Blue's spawn, they get back to the engagement faster. Blue's Zone 4 is smaller than Red's. This forces the remaining Red forces to retreat (or kills them, diminishing the force), and so Blue pushes.

Red arrives back at the fort, and another wave of players die. Because Red has one or two level 3 teleporters up, now the players are returning to the fight at about the same pace. Red's got a sentry up to pick off the Blue players that overextend. By now Blue might have a mini sentry up, or has enough snipers to pick off the Red players that overextend.

A minute of stalemate passes. A Blue Scout has snuck into Blue's Zone 4, though. They might be going to Red's spawn to shoot the teleporters. Or maybe they're engaging Red's Zone 3.

A Blue Spy has snuck around Zone 2 behind the fort, and is engaging Red's engineers behind their lines. Either the Scout or the Spy force Red's Snipers to engage them around Zone 2, which lets Blue's Zone 1 more boldly push. Likewise one of Red's Pyros and a Demo are hunting the Spy or shooting at the Scout. Red's weakened defense on Zone 1 allows Blue's Zone 1 to push up.

Blue has shifted things into their advantage. They are forcing Red to fight on their terms.

#### Batteries

I think of health and ammo pack spawn points as batteries. Controlling them gives you an advantage over enemies, and over time can heal you to full.

Take note of where the batteries are in the map, and which Zones they fall into. If a Red sniper is picking at people on the hill behind the fort, he'll have to drastically change his position to reach a battery. If you can flank him, you could take control of the battery behind him, letting you stand your ground and force him to retreat.
